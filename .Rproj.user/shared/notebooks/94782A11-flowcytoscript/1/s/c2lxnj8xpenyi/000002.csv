This simplified version of the Liston Lab flow cytometry analysis

pipeline will try to take care of as much as possible.


We're going to have you tell us what your groups are,

which markers you want to analyze, and how many cells

you want to work with.
 

After that, we'll try to cluster

your data, and provide you with visualizations in the forms

of tSNE, UMAP, PCA, heatmaps and barcharts.


For best results, make sure your R and RStudio are up-to-date.


Now we're going to try to install any of the required packages

that you don't already have installed.



That's all done. Now, on to the analysis!
