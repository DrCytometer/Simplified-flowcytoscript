Let's start by defining the groups in your experiment.
For this to work, the data files need to be named with the identifying
label for the group, and those tags need to be unique to each group.
Please type the tags (names) exactly as they appear in the files.
In the following step, you'll get the opportunity to assign new names
for each group, which will appear on the plots in the end.

Flowcytoscript will accept either FCS or CSV files as input.

If you use FCS files from a flow cytometer, a biexponential transformation will 
be applied automatically so that the data should be correctly scaled. For mass
cytometry, ArcSinh will be used. This transformation will be adapted
to the type of cytometer you have used for acquiring the data.

To have more control over the transformation (scaling) of the data, you can export
data as CSV files with the transformation already embedded in the data. To 
create these CSV-channel-value files, see the instructions.

Please select whether you are using CSV or FCS files. 

1: CSV
2: FCS

Now you'll need to select the markers (channels) you want to use for your analysis.
Enter the numbers of the channels you want. You may need to expand the console window
in order to see everything.


Please select channels for analysis:

Now we'll match the data files to the group names you entered earlier.




Files per group:

flow.sample.condition
WT KO 
 3  5 


Events per group:

  WT   KO 
2685 2813 


Events per sample:

WT.01 WT.02 WT.03 KO.01 KO.02 KO.03 KO.04 KO.05 
  454   385  1846  1829   600   173    67   144 


We found these data files matching your groups.
If this doesn't meet your expectations, you should start over
and double-check your file names vis-a-vis your group names.


Please set the number of cells (events) you'd like to use for the analysis.
This will be set as a maximum number per file, so if you set it at 2000
but you only have 500 in some samples, all 500 will be used.
The more data you analyze, the longer it will take. If you aren't sure,
maybe try for a total of no more than 100,000 (for example, 2 groups
with 5 samples per group and 10000 cells/sample gives 100000 total.)
Please enter the number without punctuation.

For your analysis, please enter a maximum number of cells you'd like to 
analyze per sample. For samples with fewer cells than this number, all 
cells will be used.
